I'm making a Flower Maintenance System simulation 
it basically lets the user simulate watering fertilizing and pruning some flowers, check if they have been maintained well based on what the user has done
Let the user choose a fixed amount of water and fertilizer that they can run out of, and if the user doesn't have any more of them then they cant water or fertilize their 
flowers which each of them needs a different amount of water and fertilizer, and also each needs different things to be done with them so they stay well maintained.
